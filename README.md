## Components

### Task

The `Task` component represents a single task item. It includes functionality to mark a task as completed, edit, or delete a task.

### TaskList

The `TaskList` component displays a list of tasks. It uses the `Task` component to render each task.

### TaskForm

The `TaskForm` component provides an input form for adding new tasks to the list.

## Redux Setup

### Actions

Actions are defined in `store/actions/taskActions.js`. They include actions for adding, deleting, toggling, and editing tasks.

### Reducers

Reducers are defined in `store/reducers/taskReducer.js`. The reducer handles the state changes based on the dispatched actions.

### Store

The Redux store is configured in `store/store.js`. It sets up the store with the task reducer.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. The configuration is defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. Global styles are included in `styles/globals.css`.
